You are tasked with implementing a simple Java program that manages a collection of fruits and their quantities using a HashMap. 
Create a ELC class FruitInventoryManagement :
Add fruits and their quantities to the HashMap.
Display the total number of entries in the HashMap.
Check if the HashMap is empty.
Retrieve and print the quantity of a specific fruit.
Check if a specific fruit exists in the HashMap.
Check if a specific quantity exists in the HashMap.

Sample Output :
Added Apple: 50
Added Banana: 30
Added Orange: 20
Total number of entries: 3
HashMap is not empty.

Quantity for Apple: 50
Quantity for Banana: 30

Orange exists in the records.
Mango does not exist in the records.

Quantity 20 exists in the records.
Quantity 100 does not exist in the records.

Ques - 2
-----------

You are tasked with implementing a Java program that demonstrates various operations on HashMap such as merging two HashMap.
Create two HashMap<String, Integer> instances to store fruit names as keys and their quantities as values.
Merge the second HashMap into the first one using the putAll method.
Use the putIfAbsent method to add an entry to the HashMap only if the key is not already present.
Use the replace method to update the value for a specific key.
Use the remove method to delete an entry from the HashMap based on the key.

Example Output :
After merging fruitInventory2 into fruitInventory1:
{Apple=50, Banana=25, Orange=20, Mango=40}

After using putIfAbsent:
{Apple=50, Banana=25, Orange=20, Mango=40, Grapes=35}

After using replace:
{Apple=50, Banana=25, Orange=25, Mango=40, Grapes=35}

After using remove:
{Apple=50, Banana=25, Orange=25, Grapes=35}

Ques - 3
-----------
Demonstrating the Use of hashCode and equals Methods in HashMap.

Create a record Class Student: 

Define a record class Student with attributes such as id: int , name: String, and age : int.
methods : 
Override the hashCode and equals methods to ensure proper comparison and hashing behavior.
The hashCode method is overridden to generate a hash code based on the id.Print some message to see the HashCode method is called at the time of adding.
The equals method is overridden to compare Student objects based on these attributes and print some message to see the equals method is executed when the address is same when hash-collision happens.

Create a ELC class Tester : 
In main method  : 
Adding Elements to a HashMap: Show how custom objects are added to a HashMap.

Retrieving Elements: Demonstrate how objects are retrieved based on keys.

Handling Duplicates: Illustrate how the equals and hashCode methods ensure unique keys in the HashMap.
