Programming Question: Student Class with Grade Calculation

 Design a Java class named Student that encapsulates information about students, including name, ID, course, fee, grade, and average. Your class should include a constructor for creating a student object by copying another student object and a method to calculate the grade based on the average.

Take a  Student class  (BLC Class)

should have the following elements:

Attributes/properties/varriables :


Names			data type		
------------		---------------       
Name      			: String
ID            		: int
Course  			: String
Fee				: double
Grade			: char
Average			: double

Acess Modifier 	:private(for all Varriables) 

Constructors:

A parameterized constructor that initializes a student object with basic information, such as name, ID, course, and fee.

A parameterized constructor that initializes a student object by copying another student object.(copy constructor)


Method:

Method Name    : calculateGrade()
Access modifier : public
Return Type       : char 
 
that initialize the grade of a student based on the average. Use the following grading scale:

A: Average >= 90
B: Average >= 80
C: Average >= 70
D: Average >= 60
F: Average < 60


Tester Class:(ELC Class)

In the main method, demonstrate the usage of the Student class by creating instances with different constructors, setting average values, and calculating grades.


Test Case-1 :
---------------
 Valid Case:

 Average = 76

 Sample Input: average = 76

Expected Output: "Grade for average 76: C"


Test Case-2 :
---------------

Valid Case: Average = 58

Sample Input: average = 58

Expected Output: "Grade for average 58: F"

Test Case-3 :
----------------
Invalid Case: mark = -10

Input: mark = -10
Expected Output: "Error: Average mark must be between 0 and 100."

package com.test1;

public class Student {
	private String name;
	private int id;
	private String course;
	private double fee;
	private char grade;
	private double average;
	public Student(String name, int id, String course, double fee,double average) {
		super();
		if(average<0) {
			System.err.println("Error: Average mark must be between 0 and 100.");
			System.exit(0);
		}
		this.name = name;
		this.id = id;
		this.course = course;
		this.fee = fee;
		this.average = average;
		
	}
	
	public Student(Student obj) {
		super();
		this.name = obj.name;
		this.id = obj.id;
		this.course = obj.course;
		this.fee = obj.fee;
        this.average= obj.average;
        this.grade=obj.grade;
		
	}
	
	public char calculateGrade() {
	
		 if(this.average>=90) {
			return this.grade='A';
		}
		else if(this.average>=80) {
			return this.grade='B';
		}
		else if(this.average>=70) {
			return this.grade='C';
		}
		else if(this.average>=60) {
			return this.grade='D';
		}
		else {
			return this.grade='F';
		}
	}
}


package com.test1;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class StudentDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println("Enter Name: ");
		String name = sc.nextLine();

		Student s1 = new Student(name,id,course,fee,average);
		Student s2 = new Student (s1);
		
		char Grade = s2.calculateGrade();
		System.out.println("Grade for average "+average+":"+Grade);
		sc.close();
